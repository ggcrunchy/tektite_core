--- Provides a helper function to prepare an element for linking.

-- **PrepLink** is called and unbind following a commit.

-- @string esub Name of element's sublink.

--
-- Calling code should invoke one or more of the following commands:
--
-- To associate events: `helper("try_events", events)`, with _events_ being a table.
--
-- For actions: `helper("try_actions", actions, akey)`, with _actions_ being a table and
-- _akey_ a string (if absent, **"actions"** is assumed).
--
-- For in-properties: `helper("try_in_properties", in_props)`, with _in\_props_ being a table.
--
-- For out-properties: ``helper("try_out_properties", out_props, pkey)`, with _out\_props_
-- being a table and _pkey_ a string (if absent, **"props"** is assumed).
--
-- For labeled in-instances: `helper("try_in_instances", itl_key, ii_key)`, with _itl\_key_ and
-- _ii\_key_ each being strings.
--
-- After that, the following call should be performed: `ok = helper("commit")`. The relevant
-- tables are searched until either `t[esub]` is non-false, in which case one of the actions
-- described below is taken (_ok_ = **true**), or all options are exhausted (_ok_ = **false**).
--
-- Each scenario asks whether _esub_ is present as a key, ignoring the associated value. In
-- the case of _events_ and _actions_, this is a direct lookup; on the other hand, properties
-- are tables of per-type tables, with these subtables being searched.
--
-- If the key is found among _events_ or _in\_props_, the corresponding event or property is
-- registered in _elem_ via @{AddId}, with the unique ID of _other_ and _osub_ as target ID
-- and sublink name, respectively.
--
-- When found among _actions_ or _out\_props_, _esub_ is added to an adaptive set: `elem[akey]`
-- or `elem[pkey]`, respectively, cf. @{tektite_core.table.adaptive.AddToSet_Member}.
--
-- Should the key be found in `elem[itl_key]`, i.e. a particular instances-to-labels map, it
-- is extracted along with the corresponding label, the map itself being removed if this
-- leaves it empty. The target is then registered much like _events_ or _in\_props_:
